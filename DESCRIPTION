Title: Signalling Pathway Gene Signatures
Version: 0.1.2
Author: Mattias Rydenfelt
Maintainer: Nils Bluethgen <nils.bluethgen@charite.de>
Description: A signaling pathway enrichment analysis tool with pathway
    signatures derived from a large number of manually curated pathway 
    perturbation experiments across many different cell types in human cells.
    Genes are scored based on causal influences of pathway perturbations as 
    opposed to pathway memberships.
